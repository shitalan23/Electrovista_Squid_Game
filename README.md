# Electrovista_Squid_Game (Red Light Green Light Detection System)

This project brings the iconic "Red Light, Green Light" game from Squid Game into reality using motion detection technology. The system uses a fixed-position camera to track participants wearing a designated color (e.g., green) and ensures they remain still during the "Red Light" phase. If motion is detected, the participant's location is identified on the ground. The system is also designed to distinguish between players and guards to prevent false detections.
